"Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with the all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the evening falls
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier
Then only for a minute (only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go",1,Marshmello
"Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down
I look at you and you look at me
Like nothing but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah
You said, ""Hey, what you doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I called you mine (ooh, ah, ooh)
Can I call you mine? (Ooh)
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
Broke kids running through the city
Drunk on the subway train
Set free every time you kissed me
We couldn't feel no pain
You looked at me and I looked at you
Like we'd never look away
Broke kids running through the city
Don't let the memory fade
You said, ""Hey, what you doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I called you mine (ooh, ah, ooh)
Can I call you mine? (Ooh)
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah
You said, ""Hey, what you doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I called you mine (ooh)
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
Can I call you mine? (Ooh, ah, ooh)
Can I call you mine? (Ooh, ah, ooh)
Can I call you mine? (Ooh, ah, ooh)
Can I call you mine?",1,Coldplay
"You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the do-o-or
Don't need make-up to cover up
Being the way that you are is enou-ou-ough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else, but you, ooh
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else, but you, ooh
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh-oh)
You don't know you're beautiful
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful",1,One_Direction
"I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go",0,Lewis_Capaldi
"I came to dance, dance, dance, dance
I hit the floor cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands
Give me space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
Cause it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on
Yeah!
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying ""Ayo! Gotta let go!""
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying ""Ayo! Baby, let's go!""
Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite!
Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon' light it up

I came to move, move, move, move
Get out the way me and my crew, crew, crew, crew

I'm gonna be the last one landing
Cause I, I, I believe it
And I, I, I, I just want it all
I just want it all
I'm gonna put my hands in the air!
Hands, hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!

"I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved",0,Lewis_Capaldi
"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Cryin' 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street",0,Olivia_Rodriguez
"She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
But now she's got a cup with something else in it
It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter-past-ten
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain
Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain
She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love too young
I was too young
Too young, too young
Too young, young
And if she ever goes back to the water fountain
The handle will be broken and the rust set in
But my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it
My heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it
Now I'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And I know that it's only a wish
And that we're not standing by the water fountain
Too young, too young
Too young, young
She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love too young
I was too young
Too young, too young
Too young, young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
(Too young) the moment that she told me that she was in love
(Too young) too young
(Young) I was too young",0,Alec Benjamin
"We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborginis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become (hey)
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (beautiful)
L.A. (mmm) drove for hours last night
And we made it nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes
When we're halfway there (all night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights
And flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you
There's no need to care
We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear (ah)
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear

"Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anything for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryin' to be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
A-B-C-D-E, F-U
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
A-B-C-D-E, F-U
You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryin' to be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
A-B-C-D-E, F-U
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
